# ocr_Varun
ocr for medical patients

## Getting started

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) with React. To run the development
server locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server prints a local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`) that you can
open in your browser. Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the server when
you're done.

### Building for production

To create an optimized build that you can deploy, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The compiled assets are emitted into the `dist/` directory. You can preview the
production build locally with:

```bash
npm run preview
```
